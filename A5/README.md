### Process of developing the tutorial ###

**•	Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?**  
| Student        | Answer |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| S214307        | Still in my 1st semester of my master, so I am not sure if the thesis will have any relevance to OpenBIM directly. But the knowledge can be used, especially if the thesis consists of data handling or collaboration between several subjects. |
| S214320      | The knowledge gained in the course provides a strong foundation for OpenBIM, making it valuable for projects that involve multidisciplinary collaboration and require the analysis of large datasets. |
| S222490      | Though my thesis is not going to be related to this, the course enabled thorough investigation through OpenBIM models which is likely an essential transferrable skill |

**•	Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?**  
| Student        | Answer |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| S214307        | The use case flexibility is nice in case a group comes up with a unique use case or develops a new use case. If not, then it is great with examples to be inspired by. This approach gives the possibility of being inspired into a more comfortable and simple use case, and also the possibility to be creative. |
| S214320      | The diversity of use cases provided valuable flexibility and a wide range of opportunities to select a focus area. The approach was not restricted to a single option, which was highly beneficial. Therefore, the number of use cases was well-balanced and appropriate. |
| S222490      | No. The use cases were well defined and diverse, incorporating a complete and fool proof perspective for any construction project |

**•	Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?**  
| Student        | Answer |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| S214307        | The tools were good, and great with instructions. Some tools had far less introduction, and were not as intuitive as may thought, making it a bit difficult to navigate through - in some cases in a bit short timeframe. Jupyter notebook could be introduced a bit more, if intended to be used in an assignment - or else leave it perhaps. |
| S214320      | The selection of tools in the course was well-balanced, offering a diverse range of options with clear instructions within the given timeframe. It was not overwhelming, and there were extensive opportunities to explore most of the tools in depth. |
| S222490      | Yes, it was the perfect amount of tools. Any lesser would have really limited the scope of learning while any more would have either created irregularities in efficiency of the tool usage or complicated the learning process by shifting the focus from learning from the tools to learning the tools instead |

### Summary on received feedback on tutorial ###

The tool is appreciated and seen as a good concept with potential, but there are suggestions for improvement in usability and flexibility.

**User Input for Cost:** Group 40 questioned if the cost is user inserted. It was clarified that cost is predefined in the code, but this could be an area for enhancement.

**Flexibility in Unit Types:** Group 44 highlighted the limitation of the tool being tailored to specific units (e.g., m²). They suggested adapting the script for other types (e.g., volume), recognizing this as a development opportunity.

**Ease of Use:** Group 42 noted that the tool requires manual code changes to fit different cases. They recommended making inputs, like search phrases, more customizable to make the tool easier to use.

The tool has a strong foundation but would benefit from added flexibility, user-friendly input options, and a more automated approach to accommodate varied needs.

Overall, the tool addresses the use case that has been identified.

**•	Conclude the journey through A1-A5**  
| Student        | Answer |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| S214307        | The journey through this course and especially the assignments A1-A5 have been very giving. The initial assignments A1 and A2 laid the foundation of how to work with the later assignments. Developing the tool later on for A3, imposed a challenge to implement the information learned from the lectures and the learning material, and cross-checking with A2 if the tool was aligning with the objective defined from A2. A4 was a great way to present the tool and get a review from an external perspective that was perhaps working on a different use case and had other struggles or solutions, that was shared. |
| S214320      | The journey from A1-A5 has been very crucial to understanding the impact, opportunities and potential of OpenBIM tools. A1 provided a solid introductory foundation for understanding the concept of OpenBIM in a manageable way. A2 created a good foundation to develop a more detailed tool in A3. With A4, it was possible to reflect upon A3 and furthermore understand the complications while developing the tool. Additionally, learning the struggles and solutions of other projects provided valuable insight. Overall, the assignments effectively contributed to a cohesive and comprehensive understanding of OpenBIM. |
| S222490      | The journey through the Advanced BIM course assignments, from A1 to A5, represents an incredible learning curve. Starting with understanding foundational BIM processes and progressing to using tools like IfcOpenShell for model analysis, the course bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application. I gained exposure to OpenBIM principles, scripting, and problem-solving. By the final assignment, there’s a clear sense of growth—not just in technical expertise, like data extraction and visualization, but also in collaborative skills through platforms like GitHub (new for me), fostering readiness for professional challenges. Overall, the course is well-balanced between providing students with relevant academic information and offering them the space to exercise real-life use cases using this information. |
